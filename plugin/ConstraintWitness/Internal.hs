-- | Magical type family that turns a constraint into a (value-level) witness.
--   The rules are:
--   Witness () -> ()
--   Witness (a ~ b) -> a :~: b
--   Witness <a typeclass constraint> -> <a dictionary for that typeclass>
--   Witness (?p :: a) -> a
--   Witness (x, y, ..., z) -> HList '[Witness x, Witness y, .., Witness z]

-- | Tries to provide a canonical witness for the given constraint. This is:
--    - () for empty constraints
--    - Refl for equality constraints
--    - the dictionary for typeclass constraints
--    - the implicit parameter's value for ImplicitParams
--    - a HList of the component constraints' canonical witnesses for conjoined constraints.
--   It's implemented by CoreToCore magic, so we leave it as `undefined` here and make sure
--   it won't be inlined so that we can still find it in the CoreToCore passes.
